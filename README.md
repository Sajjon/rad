# Demo

This demo demonstrates how I easily import a vanity account in the Radix Wallet using `Import from a Legacy Wallet` feature in App Settings, by scanning QR code shown by this software in CLI.

https://github.com/Sajjon/rad/assets/864410/3dd6e318-0b8f-4297-b39b-ad7b1bb28bb3

```sh
rad -t "hey"
```

![demo_cli](./.github/demo_cli.png)

The mnemonic is displayed in a 3x4 word coloured grid, after scanning QR input the mnemonic.

# Usage

## Help

```sh
rad --help
```

## Vanity address suffix targets as string

```
rad -p 0 -t "xx" | less
```

## Vanity address suffix targets from file

Or using a target suffixes file on format:

```plain
c00l
1337
```

```
rad -p 0 -f .suffixes.txt | less
```

If you name it `.suffixes.txt` it is already gitignored.
